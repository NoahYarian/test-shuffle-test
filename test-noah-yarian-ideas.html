/*
Here's a small problem that a client once asked us to solve as part of a larger project. The client has an existing web-based
system for delivering a test containing multiple choice questions to a learner (the relevant parts of which are included on this page).
The client asked us to modify this code so that the test questions are delivered in a random order every time a learner attempts
the test. Furthermore, the order in which the answers to the questions are presented should also be randomized.

The existing framework for creating and displaying a test has been provided for you below. Your task is to comprehend the client's
code and data structure then implement the RandomizeTest function to perform the randomization of the question and answer order.
Please explain your work and thought process.

Some background on the project from the client that may affect your solution:

-There are over 600 of these tests deployed to hundreds of thousands of users
-There are never more then 20 questions or so per test, each with no more than 6 answers but the code should be able to handle an
 arbitrary number or both questions and answers
-This code is maintained by several developers in different organizations
-The code is only required to work in all modern browsers

When submitting your response, please rename this file to include your name.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

RandomizeTest accepts and returns a Test object. The questions in the returned object should be in a random order.
The order of the choices within each question should also be randomized.

// A main question here in writing this function is "how random does this need to be?" Is this for professional certifications
// or is this in elementary school classrooms? For now I've settled on using a generally accepted, yet non-cryptographic level
// shuffling algorithm, but also on getting a new random seed for the question order and the choice/answer order. It wouldn't
// affect this test, as it appears to be manually randomized to a degree already, but writing future tests could be more
// straightforward as the correct choices and answers could be listed first in the array.
// If this needed to be as random as possible, thoughts I have would be to use the random.org API to get a random number on demand // (if an internet connection is available and could be sufficiently protected), a local hardware random number generator,
// Chance.js or another library, or... well I see now there's a Web Crypto API. Time to implement it here!
// Ok, updated. I have it working for a max of 256 questions / choices.
// Ok. Up to 65536 questions / choices now! Next I will slim this all back down into something more easily
// understood and maintained.
// Update- I finished the code cleanup and I've made it simple and easy to read. This was fun!

                                                      // like overkill to me but it crossed my mind.

// When prompted with the need to shuffle, I recalled that lodash has a shuffle method,
// so I checked out their source code for it, as well as Underscore's, as their code is purposefully
// simpler but more approachable. Both libraries deal with collections and edge cases, so I really
// didn't need much of what they offered. I ended up finding the function below after writing my own,
// less clean function, so I've opted for theirs over mine. At the time I was figuring out the seed
// after shuffling the array and comparing it to the initial array with another function, so I had to
// avoid modifying the array in place. Here's mine from before:
//
// function shuffleArr(arr) {
//   var orderedArr = [];
//   var randomizedArr = [];

//   for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
//     orderedArr[i] = arr[i];
//   }

//   while (orderedArr.length > 0) {
//     var randIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * orderedArr.length);
//     randomizedArr.push(orderedArr.splice(randIndex, 1)[0]);
//   }

//   return randomizedArr;
// }

  var rand, temp, i;

  for (i = ary.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    rand = getRandomInt(0, i); // get random between zero and i (inclusive)
